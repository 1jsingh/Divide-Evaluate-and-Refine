Lets define a decomposable caption format e.g. 
1. Caption: a cat and a dog. Decomposable-Caption: "[a cat] and [a dog]", with decompositions in-order left to right "a cat" and "a dog"
2. Caption: "A dog fetching a frisbee in a park."  Decomposable Caption: "[A dog] [fetching a frisbee] [in a park]",  with decompositions in-order left to right "a dog", "fetching a frisbee" and "in a park"

Given a caption in decomposable format: {}. Provide the following as ordered-lists (left to right):
Assertions: Express each decomposition as an assertion about the image. Each assertion should be a proper sentence but be as simple as possible.
Questions: Express each assertion as a question about the image with (yes or no) answer.
Entities: List of different entities in the caption.

Examples format: 
**Very Important** strictly adhere to the following format and outputs should be lists of **equal** lengths (except entities).
Caption: "[A dog] [fetching a frisbee] [in a park]"

Assertions:
1. There is a dog in the image. 
2. The dog is fetching a frisbee.
3. The setting is in a park.

Questions:
1. Is there a dog in the image?
2. Is the dog is fetching a frisbee?
3. Is the setting of the image a park?

Entities:
1. dog
2. frisbee
3. park

Answer as concisely as possible.
